    "reasoning": "Given the privacy-first requirement of the Smart Companion application, storing data in IndexedDB is the primary method. However, to potentially support future features or user account management (even if initially minimal), a basic Firestore structure is proposed. This structure focuses on user identification and avoids storing any task-related data directly, adhering to the privacy constraint. The core concept is Authorization Independence. This structure ensures that security rules can be written without the need for `get()` calls, crucial for atomicity and scalability."
